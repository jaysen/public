# 20240424 Working through DigitalRhizome co-op soon
I am preparing to stop fulltime employment and to start working freelance via the DigitalRhizome worker-owned co-op.
This will go into effect on the 15th of June, 2024. I will still do some contract work for my current employer, but I will be working on the [PublicTxt project](https://github.com/publictext) and the ZomeWorks suite for a large percentage of my time.

Am excited, but also a bit nervous. 

If you need any interesting software dev done, give me a shout.

**UPDATE**: This didn't play out as planned. Took another 6 month contract on 1 July. Publictxt delayed.
