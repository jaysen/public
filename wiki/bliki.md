## The Bliki Site 
- A blog and wiki hybrid
  - see https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html 
- using Github repo and/or Github pages.
- with Jekyll or similar to convert md to html using templates.
- Combining it with an Obsidian.md vault

## Plain Github Repo Option
- this is currently what I'm using
- blog and wiki files in a github repo
- linking between files using markdown links
- no static site generation

## Static Site Generator Options
- Jekyll - used by Github pages, and I've used it before...
- Pelican (Python!)
- Hugo
- Gatsby
- Eleventy

## Combining with Obsidian.md
- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is a markdown based note taking app
- It has a plugin to publish to a static site (using Jekyll) (???)
- Github publisher plugin for Obsidian.md
  - https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher
- Python project to convert Obsidian.md vault to Jekyll site

- Blog & wiki posts as [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) activities
